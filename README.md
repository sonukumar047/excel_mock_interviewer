## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project uses a modern, decoupled architecture for scalability and maintainability.


git clone https://github.com/sonukumar047/excel-mock-interviewer.git
cd excel-mock-interviewer


### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.


Now, open the `.env` file and add your Groq API key:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here


### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages.

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Run the Application with Docker Compose

This is the recommended method as it handles both the FastAPI application and the Redis service.

docker-compose up --build


The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. (Alternative) Manual Local Run

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the services manually.

**Start Redis Server:**

redis-server

**Run the FastAPI App:**

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
